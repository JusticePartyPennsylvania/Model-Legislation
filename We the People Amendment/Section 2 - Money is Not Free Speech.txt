Section 2. [Money is Not Free Speech]

Federal, State, and local government shall regulate, limit, or prohibit contributions and expenditures, including a
candidate's own contributions and expenditures, to ensure that all citizens, regardless of their economic status, have 
access to the political process, and that no person gains, as a result of their money, substantially more access or ability 
to influence in any way the election of any candidate for public office or any ballot measure.

Federal, State, and local government shall require that any permissible contributions and expenditures be publicly disclosed.

The judiciary shall not construe the spending of money to influence elections to be speech under the First Amendment.
